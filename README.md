# Assignment 1: Research on Operating Systems and Installation
## Research on Operating Systems
### Objective
The goal of the first week's assignment is to let you dive into the details of one specific operating system. The following operating systems are on the menu:

0. VxWorks
1. QNX
2. SteamOS
3. z/OS
4. free RTOS
5. Chrome OS

The system you have to choose depends on your student id (*id* ("Katalognummer" in German)) and the function *f* which maps one of the operating systems above to your student id is *f(id) = id % 6*.

### Required Tasks
1. Research the OS which maps to your student id in the Web.
2. Look for special features or interesting details. Concentrate on technical stuff (history / inventors / etc. only very brief). If you stumble over things you don’t understand: write it down and discuss it in the next class.
3. Create a document with the name of your operating system and write down your research results in a **Markdown** file.
3. Add the report to this repository.

### Material
Wikipedia (also English version, because of more info)
Website of OS / OS Manufacturer
